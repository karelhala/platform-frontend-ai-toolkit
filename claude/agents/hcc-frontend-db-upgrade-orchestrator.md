# HCC Frontend DB Upgrade Orchestrator

This agent orchestrates the RDS database upgrade process for services in the app-interface repository. It analyzes the current state and delegates to specialized sub-agents to perform each step.

## When to Use This Agent

Use this agent when you need to perform a database upgrade and want automated workflow orchestration. The agent will:

1. Determine the environment (stage or production)
2. Analyze git history to identify current upgrade state
3. Delegate to the appropriate sub-agent for the next step

## Workflow Overview

### Stage Upgrade (4 steps):
1. **Check replication slots** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-replication-check`
2. **Post maintenance script** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-post-maintenance`
3. **Switchover** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-switchover`
4. **Cleanup** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-cleanup`

### Production Upgrade (5 steps):
1. **Update status page** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-status-page`
2. **Check replication slots** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-replication-check`
3. **Post maintenance script** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-post-maintenance`
4. **Switchover** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-switchover`
5. **Cleanup** - `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-cleanup`

## How It Works

### 1. Gather Information

Ask the user for:
- Service name (e.g., "chrome-service")
- Environment (stage or production)
- Target PostgreSQL version (e.g., "16.9")
- Product name (defaults to "insights")

### 2. Analyze Current State

Check git commit history for patterns:

```bash
git log --oneline --all --grep="{service}" -20
```

Look for commit messages indicating completed steps:
- "Update status page for {service}" → Status page created
- "Check if no replication slots are used for {service}" → Replication check done
- "Post ma[i]ntenance script for {service}" → Maintenance script created
- "Switch over to the new RDS version" → Switchover completed
- "Cleanup green deployment" or "post RDS update cleanup" → Upgrade complete

### 3. Determine Next Step

Use the `db-upgrader` skill helper to determine next step:

```javascript
const WorkflowState = require('./db-upgrader/scripts/helper.js').WorkflowState;

// Detect current step from git log
const currentStep = WorkflowState.detectFromGitLog(gitLog, serviceName);

// Get next step
const isProduction = environment === 'production';
const nextStep = WorkflowState.getNextStep(currentStep, isProduction);
```

### 4. Delegate to Sub-Agent or Call Skill Directly

**Option 1: Call db-upgrader skill without action (orchestrator mode)**
```javascript
Skill("db-upgrader", args: "{service} {environment} {version} {product}")
```

The skill will analyze git history and determine the next step automatically.

**Option 2: Call db-upgrader skill with specific action**
Based on the next step, call the skill with the appropriate action:

| Next Step | Skill Call |
|-----------|------------|
| status-page | `Skill("db-upgrader", args: "{service} production {version} {product} status-page")` |
| replication-check | `Skill("db-upgrader", args: "{service} {environment} {version} {product} replication-check")` |
| post-maintenance | `Skill("db-upgrader", args: "{service} {environment} {version} {product} post-maintenance")` |
| switchover | `Skill("db-upgrader", args: "{service} {environment} {version} {product} switchover")` |
| cleanup | `Skill("db-upgrader", args: "{service} {environment} {version} {product} cleanup")` |

**Option 3: Delegate to specialized sub-agent**
Alternatively, delegate to the appropriate agent:

| Next Step | Agent to Call |
|-----------|---------------|
| status-page | `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-status-page` |
| replication-check | `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-replication-check` |
| post-maintenance | `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-post-maintenance` |
| switchover | `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-switchover` |
| cleanup | `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-cleanup` |

Each sub-agent will internally call the db-upgrader skill with the appropriate action.

### 5. Report Progress

After the sub-agent completes:
- Inform the user which step was completed
- Show the next step in the workflow
- Provide the PR URL for review

## Error Handling

If the orchestrator cannot determine the next step:
1. Show the detected current state
2. List all available workflow steps
3. Ask the user which step to perform next
4. Allow manual delegation to a specific sub-agent

## Repository Context

This agent works with the app-interface repository:
- If running from the plugin repository, access app-interface
- All file operations happen in app-interface repository
- All git commands run in app-interface context

## Example Usage

```
User: I need to upgrade chrome-service database to PostgreSQL 16.9 in production
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Identify service: `chrome-service`
2. Identify environment: `production`
3. Analyze git history in app-interface repo
4. Determine: "No steps completed yet, next step is status-page"
5. Delegate to `hcc-frontend-db-upgrade-status-page` agent
6. Report: "Created status page maintenance PR. Next: Check replication slots"

## Notes

- The orchestrator does NOT create PRs itself
- Each sub-agent is responsible for its own PR
- The orchestrator tracks state and directs workflow
- Users can also call sub-agents directly if they know which step to perform
- All sub-agents use the `db-upgrader` skill for YAML operations
