# HCC Frontend AI Toolkit

A custom Claude Code marketplace and plugin repository for frontend development teams.

## What is this?

This repository serves as both:
1. A **Claude Code plugin** containing custom agents and MCP servers for frontend development
2. A **custom plugin marketplace** for your team's agent distribution

This approach allows your team to have a centralized location for all frontend development agents, MCP servers, and easily distribute them across the team.

## Getting Started

### 🤖 Claude Code Setup

#### Install the Plugin

```bash
# 1. Add this repository as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit

# 2. Install the plugin from the marketplace
/plugin install hcc-frontend-ai-toolkit@hcc-frontend-toolkit
```

📖 For more details on Claude Code plugins, see the [official plugin guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins#install-and-manage-plugins).

#### ⚠️ Important: Restart Required

**After installation, restart your Claude Code session to see the agents and other features.**

#### Team Configuration (Optional)

For automatic marketplace setup across your team, add this to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "hcc-frontend-toolkit": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Test Your Installation

After installation and restart, test the plugin:

```bash
# Test the hello world agent
Task with subagent_type='hcc-frontend-hello-world' to greet the user
```

The hello world agent should identify itself as part of the HCC Frontend AI Toolkit plugin, confirming successful installation.

### 🖱️ Cursor Setup

This repository contains **Agents** (Rules) and **Tools** (MCPs) configured specifically for our team's workflows.

#### Option A: Install Script (Recommended)

Download and run the install script in the root of **your** project:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/install-cursor.sh | bash
```

#### Option B: Manual One-Liner

Run this command in the root of **your** project (the app you are working on, not this repo) to download the latest agents:

```bash
# Creates .cursor/rules and downloads our team agents
mkdir -p .cursor/rules && \
curl -o .cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/cursor/rules/hello-world.mdc && \
curl -o .cursor/rules/patternfly-component-builder.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/cursor/rules/patternfly-component-builder.mdc && \
curl -o .cursor/rules/patternfly-dataview-specialist.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/cursor/rules/patternfly-dataview-specialist.mdc && \
curl -o .cursor/rules/storybook-specialist.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/cursor/rules/storybook-specialist.mdc && \
curl -o .cursor/rules/typescript-type-refiner.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/cursor/rules/typescript-type-refiner.mdc && \
curl -o .cursor/rules/unit-test-writer.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/cursor/rules/unit-test-writer.mdc && \
curl -o .cursor/rules/weekly-report.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/master/cursor/rules/weekly-report.mdc
```

*Restart Cursor after running this.*

#### Option C: Manual Setup

**1. Installing Agents (Rules)**

1.  Navigate to your project's root folder.
2.  Create a folder named `.cursor/rules/`.
3.  Copy the `.mdc` files from `cursor/rules/` in this repo into that folder.
4.  **Verify:** Open Cursor, type `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`), and you should see the agents appear in the context menu.

**2. Connecting Tools (MCPs)**

1.  Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`).
2.  Navigate to **General \> MCP**.
3.  Locate `cursor/mcp-template.json` in this repo.
4.  Copy the configuration for the tools you need and click **"Add new MCP server"** in Cursor.
5.  **Note:** The MCP server will automatically use the published NPM package `@redhat-cloud-services/hcc-pf-mcp`.

#### How to Use Cursor

  * **Chat:** Tag an agent by typing `@patternfly-component-builder` or `@typescript-type-refiner` in the chat window.
  * **Composer:** In Composer (`Cmd+I`), the agents will automatically activate based on the file types you are editing (e.g., TypeScript files will auto-activate the type refiner).

## Agent Development

### 📋 Development Guidelines

**Want to create your own agents?** See our comprehensive guide: [AGENT_GUIDELINES.md](AGENT_GUIDELINES.md)

This guide covers:
- How to scope agents effectively (small and focused)
- Using Claude Code's `/agents` command for development
- Naming conventions and best practices
- Examples of well-designed vs poorly-designed agents

### Quick Start: Creating an Agent

1. **Use Claude Code** - Create agents using the `/agents` command in Claude Code
2. **Follow naming convention** - Use the `hcc-frontend-` prefix (e.g., `hcc-frontend-css-utilities`)
3. **Keep focused scope** - Agents should be small and specialized (CSS utilities, hook testing, etc.)
4. **Use proper format** - Follow the [Claude agent file format](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#file-format)

### Agent File Format

Agents use the **Claude format** with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this agent specializes in
capabilities: ["specific-task-1", "specific-task-2", "specific-task-3"]
---

# Agent Name

Detailed description of when and how Claude should use this agent...
```

### Development Workflow

When modifying Claude agents:

1. **Edit** Claude agent files in `claude/agents/`
2. **Convert** to Cursor format: `npm run convert-cursor`
3. **Verify** sync: `npm run check-cursor-sync`
4. **Commit** both Claude and Cursor files

### ⚠️ Important: Cursor Rules Sync

**When you modify Claude agents, you MUST regenerate the Cursor rules before committing.**

Our CI will **automatically fail** if Cursor rules are out of sync with Claude agents.

```bash
# 1. Edit a Claude agent
vim claude/agents/hcc-frontend-example.md

# 2. Regenerate Cursor rules
npm run convert-cursor

# 3. Verify everything is in sync
npm run check-cursor-sync

# 4. Commit both changes
git add claude/agents/hcc-frontend-example.md cursor/rules/example.mdc
git commit -m "feat: update example agent"
```

## Using the Toolkit

### Generating Weekly Team Reports

The toolkit includes a powerful weekly reporting feature that automatically analyzes your team's JIRA activity.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install the HCC Frontend AI Toolkit plugin (see Getting Started above)
2. Configure the [mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) MCP server
3. Set up your JIRA credentials (see below)
4. Reload Claude Code/VSCode

**Setting up JIRA MCP Server:**

Add the following to your Claude Code MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-atlassian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sooperset/mcp-atlassian"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_BASE_URL": "https://issues.redhat.com",
        "JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN": "your-jira-personal-access-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Getting your JIRA Personal Access Token:**
1. Log in to your JIRA instance
2. Go to your Profile Settings
3. Navigate to Security → Create and manage API tokens
4. Create a new token and copy it
5. Use this token as the value for `JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN`

**Basic Usage:**

Simply ask Claude Code to generate a report:

```
"Show me what Platform Framework accomplished this week"
```

Claude Code will:
- Automatically calculate the date range (last Wednesday through today)
- Query JIRA for your team's completed work
- Analyze and categorize issues into meaningful sections
- Generate a formatted report with statistics and insights

**The report includes:**
- 📊 Summary statistics (total issues, breakdown by type)
- ✅ Accomplishments (security, quality, product features, infrastructure)
- ⚠️ Risks and blockers
- 🤝 Cross-team dependencies
- 👥 Team health indicators

## Contributing

### Adding or Updating Agents

1. **Follow naming convention** with `hcc-frontend-` prefix
2. **Place agent files** in the `claude/agents/` directory
3. **Include proper frontmatter** with description and capabilities
4. **Regenerate Cursor rules** after making changes:
   ```bash
   npm run convert-cursor
   ```
5. **Verify sync** before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run check-cursor-sync
   ```
6. **Test agents** before submitting pull requests
7. **Update plugin version** in `plugin.json` for releases

### CI Integration

#### CI Check:
- **Triggers on:** PRs that modify `claude/agents/`, `cursor/rules/`, or conversion scripts
- **Validates:** Cursor rules match Claude agents exactly
- **Fails if:** Rules are out of sync or conversion script produces different output

#### Local Development:
```bash
# Check if rules are in sync
npm run check-cursor-sync

# Fix sync issues
npm run convert-cursor

# Pre-commit hook runs automatically via Husky
git commit -m "feat: update agent" # Will run sync check
```

#### Pre-commit Protection:
- **Husky pre-commit hook** automatically runs `npm run check-cursor-sync`
- **Commits will fail** if Cursor rules are out of sync
- **Fix by running** `npm run convert-cursor` before committing
