# HCC Frontend AI Toolkit

A custom Claude Code marketplace and plugin repository for frontend development teams.

## What is this?

This repository serves as both:
1. A **Claude Code plugin** containing custom agents for frontend development
2. A **custom plugin marketplace** for your team's agent distribution

This approach allows your team to have a centralized location for all frontend development agents and easily distribute them across the team.

## Installation

### Add Marketplace and Install Plugin

```bash
# 1. Add this repository as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit

# 2. Install the plugin from the marketplace
/plugin install hcc-frontend-ai-toolkit@hcc-frontend-toolkit
```

📖 For more details on Claude Code plugins, see the [official plugin guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins#install-and-manage-plugins).

### ⚠️ Important: Restart Required

**After installation, restart your Claude Code session to see the agents and other features.**

### Team Configuration (Optional)

For automatic marketplace setup across your team, add this to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "hcc-frontend-toolkit": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "RedHatInsights/platform-frontend-ai-toolkit"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to support multiple agenic configurations:

```
platform-frontend-ai-toolkit/           # Repository root
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json                 # Marketplace configuration (root level)
├── claude/                              # Claude Code plugin subdirectory
│   ├── .claude-plugin/
│   │   └── plugin.json                  # Plugin manifest
│   └── agents/                          # Agent definitions
│       └── hcc-frontend-hello-world.md
├── LICENSE
└── README.md                           # This file
```

This structure allows you to:
- Add other agenic configurations in separate subdirectories (e.g., `openai/`, `anthropic/`, etc.)
- Keep the marketplace configuration at the root level
- Organize different AI toolkits by subdirectory

## Agent Format

Agents in this plugin use the standard format with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: What this agent specializes in
capabilities: ["task1", "task2", "task3"]
---

# Agent Name

Detailed description of when and how Claude should use this agent...
```
